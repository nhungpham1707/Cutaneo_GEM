A genome-scale constraint-based metabolic model of Cryptococcus curvatus was constructed using Yarrowia lypolitica model iNL895 as a template. The model was then used to study lipid synthesis in C.curvatus.
Start date: Nov-2016

The data folder contains data to draft, curate and validate the model. 
The script folder contains code to build model (construction folder), Validation (same name folder), and Simulation (same name folder). 
    In the construction folder, BuildCryptoGEM is the master script to build C.curvatus model. This function calls all other function in the current folder to build the model.
    More details are explained in the script.
